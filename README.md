Monitor is a collection of two scripts made for server monitoring.
The first one gets various info and informs the administrator via telegram when cpu/ram usage is very high 
The second script logs all active connections.

Todo :
1 Fix notification frequency 
2 Use less functions to get metrics

Run: 
sudo bash metrics.sh && sudo bash network.sh
